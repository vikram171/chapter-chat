## Notes

- One challenge was ensuring environment variables loaded correctly with Vite. Restarting the dev server fixed it.
- Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) needed to be disabled and proper table permissions granted to allow post and comment manipulation.
- Handling asynchronous state updates after mutation (e.g. upvotes/comments) was resolved using manual state updates and re-fetches.
